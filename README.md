- **Search Products**: Includes a search bar to filter products by category (Men, Women, Children).
- **Sign In/Register Page**: A mock sign-in and registration page that displays success alerts upon submission.
- **Routing**: Uses `react-router-dom` for page navigation.

### Components:

**NavBar:** The main navigation bar, which includes links to home, deals (products), and sign-in/register.

**Footer**: The footer section of the page (if implemented).
ProductCard: A card component to display individual products on the product page.

### Pages:
